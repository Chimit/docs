> Estimated Upgrade Time: 1.5 Hours

## Updating dependencies

> Likelihood Of Impact: High

### PHP 8.2.0 required
Nutgram now requires PHP 8.2.0 or greater.

### Laravel support moved in another package
Starting from the latest update, the Laravel support for Nutgram has been moved to a new package. To continue utilizing Laravel functionality in Nutgram, it is necessary to install the composer package "nutgram/laravel":

```bash
composer require nutgram/laravel
```

To streamline the integration process, the previous package `nutgram/nutgram` is now included within the `nutgram/laravel` package.<br/>
This means that if you install `nutgram/laravel`, you can safely remove `nutgram/nutgram` as it is already incorporated.

## Enums

### Attributes to Enums

> Likelihood Of Impact: Medium

The Attributes (Class with constants) have been converted to Enums.
If you were previously using the value directly, now you will need to use `->value` to obtain the raw value.

### Renamed namespace

> Likelihood Of Impact: Medium

The namespace has been renamed using `Properties` name:
```diff
- use SergiX44\Nutgram\Telegram\Attributes\X;
+ use SergiX44\Nutgram\Telegram\Properties\X;
```

### Naming

> Likelihood Of Impact: Medium

The names of the enums are now in **singular** form.

| From               | To                |
|:-------------------|:------------------|
| ChatActions        | ChatAction        |
| Emojis             | DiceEmoji         |
| MessageEntityTypes | MessageEntityType |
| MessageTypes       | MessageType       |
| PassportSources    | PassportSource    |
| PassportTypes      | PassportType      |
| UpdateTypes        | UpdateType        |

## Nutgram config

### Config parameter

> Likelihood Of Impact: High

The constructor of the `Nutgram` class now accepts the `Configuration` class as the second parameter. 
However, it is still possible to use the static method `fromArray` to continue using an array.

```diff
- $bot = new Nutgram('TOKEN', [
-     'timeout' => 5 
- ]);
+ $bot = new Nutgram('TOKEN', new Configuration(
+     clientTimeout: 5
+ ));
OR
+ $bot = new Nutgram('TOKEN', Configuration::fromArray([
+     'timeout' => 5
+ );
```

### splitLongMessages option

> Likelihood Of Impact: Medium

The feature "Split long text message to multiple messages" has been removed and replaced by the Chunked endpoints: 
`sendChunkedMessage`, `sendChunkedPhoto`, `sendChunkedAudio`, `sendChunkedDocument`, `sendChunkedVideo`, 
`sendChunkedAnimation`, and `sendChunkedVoice`.

## Types

### StickerSet object

> Likelihood Of Impact: Low

The deprecated `contains_mask` property from `StickerSet` object has been removed.
Use `sticker_type` property instead.

### Custom types

> Likelihood Of Impact: Low

We have made a complete revision by replacing our custom-created objects, namely 
`EditedMessage`, `ChannelPost`, and `EditedChannelPost`, with the `Message` object within the `Update`. 
This change applies to their respective properties: `edited_message`, `channel_post`, and `edited_channel_post`.

## Endpoints

### Signature

> Likelihood Of Impact: Very High

The conversion of all endpoint signatures from **array** to **parameters** enables 
the convenient utilization of **named parameters**. 
Moreover, the parameter sorting will be configured in a way that mandatory parameters come first, 
followed by optional ones, while the `$clientOpt` parameter, if present, will always be placed at the end.

You'll need to convert the usages from the old logic to the new one like this example:
```diff
- $bot->sendMessage('my text', [
-     'disable_notification' => true
- ]);
+ $bot->sendMessage('my text', 
+     disable_notification: true
+ );
```

### Group method

> Likelihood Of Impact: High

The `group` method has been modified from the old logic, where it accepted the middleware as a parameter, 
to the new logic, where the middleware is set using the `middleware` method.

The updated code would be as follows:
```diff
- $bot->group(Middleware::class, function (Nutgram $bot){
-     // Your handlers here
- });
+ $bot->group(function (Nutgram $bot){
+     // Your handlers here
+ })->middleware(Middleware::class);
```

## Handlers

### onPoll handler

> Likelihood Of Impact: Medium

The deprecated `onPoll` handler has been removed.
Instead, you need to use `onUpdatePoll` handler:
```diff
- $bot->onPoll(YourPollHandler::class);
+ $bot->onUpdatePoll(YourPollHandler::class);
```

### Case sensitive pattern

> Likelihood Of Impact: Medium

The `$pattern` parameter used in the specified handlers: `onCallbackQueryData`, `onPreCheckoutQueryPayload`, `onSuccessfulPaymentPayload`, `onText`, `onCommand`, `onException` and `onApiError` is now **case sensitive**.

## Persisting data

### setData & getData
> Likelihood Of Impact: Medium

The methods `setData` and `getData` have been renamed to `set` and `get` respectively.
